## Examples

```
feat(customer): add restaurant search functionality

Implemented search box on the restaurant listing page that allows customers
to filter restaurants by name or cuisine type. Added proper indexing in the
database to optimize search performance.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(cart): resolve issue with item quantities not updating

Fixed a bug where changing item quantities in the cart would sometimes
revert to previous values. The issue was caused by a race condition in
the state update logic.

Fixes #123
```

## AI Agent Commit Rules

When making commits as an AI agent:

1. Always run `git add .` from the workspace root to stage changes
2. Review staged changes before committing to ensure no unintended files are included
3. Format commit titles as `type(scope): brief description`
4. Keep commit title brief and descriptive (max 72 chars)
5. Add two line breaks after commit title
6. Include a detailed body paragraph explaining:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were necessary
   - Any important implementation details
7. Reference related issue numbers using `Closes #XX` or `Fixes #XX` where applicable
8. End commit message with " -Agent Generated Commit Message"
9. Push changes to the current remote branch
