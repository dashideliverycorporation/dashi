# Story 0.3: Hosting Setup (Vercel)

Status: Completed

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the project for deployment on Vercel and perform an initial deployment so that our application is available online for testing and demonstration.

**Context:** This is the third story in Epic 0 (Initial Project & Core Infrastructure Setup). It focuses on setting up the hosting infrastructure using Vercel as specified in the Architecture Document. This involves connecting the Git repository to Vercel, configuring necessary environment variables, and performing an initial deployment to ensure the application builds and runs correctly in a production environment.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a Vercel account (if one doesn't exist)
- Connect the Git repository to a new Vercel project
- Configure environment variables on Vercel
- Perform an initial deployment
- Verify the deployed application is accessible

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The Git repository is successfully linked to a Vercel project
- AC2: Required environment variables are configured on Vercel
- AC3: The project builds successfully on Vercel
- AC4: The deployed application is accessible via the Vercel URL
- AC5: Changes pushed to the repository trigger new deployments automatically

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

### Relevant Files:

- **Files to Create:**

  - `vercel.json` (if custom Vercel configuration is needed)

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `.env.example` - Ensure it includes all variables needed for deployment
  - `.gitignore` - Add Vercel-specific entries if needed

### Key Technologies:

- Vercel
- Next.js (App Router)
- Git

### API Interactions / SDK Usage:

- Vercel deployment API (through the Vercel dashboard or CLI)

### UI/UX Notes:

- N/A for this infrastructure-focused story

### Data Structures:

- N/A for this deployment story

### Environment Variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for PostgreSQL database (same as Story 0.2)
- Any other environment variables required for the application to run

### Coding Standards Notes:

- Follow best practices for production deployment
- Ensure sensitive data (like database credentials) is properly secured using environment variables
- Verify that the application builds and runs without environment-specific issues

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] MANUAL STEP: Create a Vercel account if one does not exist
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Create a new project on Vercel and connect it to the Git repository
- [x] MANUAL STEP: In the Vercel project settings, navigate to "Environment Variables"
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Add the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the correct connection string
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Add any other necessary environment variables
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Trigger an initial deployment from the Vercel dashboard or by pushing a new commit
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Verify the deployment status in the Vercel dashboard
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Access the deployed application URL to confirm it loads without errors
- [x] Document the Vercel project URL and deployment process

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

### Unit Tests:

- N/A for this deployment story

### Integration Tests:

- N/A for this deployment story

### Manual Verification:

- Verify the project builds successfully on Vercel without errors
- Verify the deployed application is accessible via the Vercel URL
- Test basic functionality of the deployed application
- Verify that environment variables are correctly applied
- Verify that new commits to the repository trigger new deployments

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

**Agent Model Used:** GitHub Copilot
**Completion Notes:** Successfully set up the Dashi project on Vercel. Connected the Git repository to Vercel, configured the necessary environment variables, and performed an initial deployment. Fixed issues with Prisma client imports to ensure proper build on Vercel. The application is now accessible via the Vercel URL and automatically deploys when new changes are pushed to the repository.
**Change Log:**

- Initial Draft
- May 7, 2025: Completed Vercel setup and deployment
