# Story 5.5: Order Confirmation Page/View

Status: Ready

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a customer who has placed an order, I want to see an order confirmation page so that I know my order was successful and understand what happens next.

**Context:** This is the fifth story in Epic 5 (Customer Ordering & History). It builds upon Story 5.4 (Place Order Backend Logic) and completes the ordering flow by providing customers with immediate visual confirmation of their successful order. This story creates a clear, informative confirmation page that displays order details, payment instructions, and next steps, giving customers confidence that their order has been received and is being processed.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create an order confirmation page that:
  - Is displayed immediately after successful order placement
  - Shows a clear success message with visual indicator (e.g., checkmark icon)
  - Displays a comprehensive summary of the order including:
    - Order ID/reference number
    - Restaurant name
    - Order items with quantities and prices
    - Order total
    - Delivery address
    - Any notes provided
    - Timestamp of order placement
- Include information about the payment process:
  - Clearly state that payment is to be made directly to the restaurant on delivery
  - Explain that no online payment is required at this time
- Provide details about next steps:
  - Inform the customer that the restaurant will prepare their order
  - Explain that the order status is "New" and the restaurant will be notified
  - Mention that the customer can view order status in their order history
- Include navigation options:
  - "View Order History" button/link to order history page
  - "Continue Shopping" button/link to return to the homepage
- Ensure all static text is properly set up for localization (English and French)
- Apply styling consistent with the design system (orange theme)
- Ensure the page is fully responsive on all device sizes
- Implement route protection to prevent direct access to confirmation page without an order ID

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Customers are automatically redirected to the confirmation page after successful order placement
- AC2: A clear success message with visual indicator is displayed
- AC3: Complete order details (ID, restaurant, items, total, address, notes, timestamp) are shown
- AC4: Payment information (direct payment to restaurant) is clearly stated
- AC5: Next steps regarding order preparation are explained
- AC6: Navigation options for order history and homepage are provided
- AC7: The page cannot be directly accessed without a valid order ID parameter
- AC8: All text content is properly localized and supports language switching
- AC9: The page is responsive and displays correctly on all screen sizes
- AC10: Order details match those saved in the database

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

### Relevant Files:

- **Files to Create:**

  - `app/order-confirmation/[orderId]/page.tsx` - Order confirmation page component
  - `components/order/OrderConfirmationSummary.tsx` - Component to display order summary
  - `components/order/PaymentInformation.tsx` - Component for payment instructions
  - `components/order/NextSteps.tsx` - Component explaining next steps

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `server/trpc/routers/order.ts` - Add procedure to fetch order details by ID
  - `components/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx` - Update to redirect to confirmation page after successful order

### Key Technologies:

- Next.js (App Router) for page routing and components
- TypeScript for type safety
- tRPC for fetching order details
- Shadcn UI components for layout and display elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- react-i18next for localization
- Lucide React for icons

### API Interactions / SDK Usage:

- tRPC procedure for fetching order details by ID
- Auth.js `useSession` hook for authentication checks
- `next/navigation` for routing and redirection

### UI/UX Notes:

- Follow the DoorDash-inspired orange theme
- Use a prominent success message with a checkmark icon
- Organize order information in clearly defined sections with appropriate headings
- Use card components to visually separate different sections of information
- Apply consistent spacing and typography from the design system
- Use appropriate icons to enhance visual communication (e.g., clock for timestamp, location for address)
- "View Order History" button should be prominent with the primary color
- "Continue Shopping" button can use a secondary/ghost style
- Consider subtle animation for the success message/icon
- Ensure ample whitespace for readability
- Clearly distinguish between different sections with borders or background colors

### Data Structures:

- Order details type:

  ```typescript
  interface OrderDetails {
    id: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    status: OrderStatus;
    total: number;
    deliveryAddress: string;
    notes: string | null;
    customer: {
      name: string;
      email: string;
    };
    restaurant: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
    };
    items: Array<{
      id: string;
      name: string;
      price: number;
      quantity: number;
    }>;
  }
  ```

- Order status enum:

  ```typescript
  enum OrderStatus {
    NEW = "NEW",
    PREPARING = "PREPARING",
    READY = "READY",
    COMPLETED = "COMPLETED",
    CANCELLED = "CANCELLED",
  }
  ```

### Environment Variables:

- No new environment variables needed for this story

### Coding Standards Notes:

- Follow TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Use server components for initial data fetching
- Use client components for interactive elements
- Add appropriate error handling for cases where order ID is invalid or not found
- Ensure the page is only accessible to the customer who placed the order
- Create reusable, single-responsibility components
- Add appropriate accessibility attributes to all elements
- Follow established localization patterns using translation keys
- Ensure responsive design with appropriate Tailwind classes
- Document complex logic with JSDoc comments
- Follow project UI/UX standards for page design

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create tRPC procedure to fetch order details by ID (with auth check)
- [ ] Add the new procedure to the order router
- [ ] Create OrderConfirmationSummary component to display order details
- [ ] Create PaymentInformation component for payment instructions
- [ ] Create NextSteps component explaining what happens next
- [ ] Create order confirmation page with dynamic route parameter
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Update checkout form to redirect to confirmation page on success
- [ ] Style all components according to design system
- [ ] Set up localization for all text content
- [ ] Add responsive styling for different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement error handling for invalid or missing order IDs
- [ ] Add client-side tests for components
- [ ] Add integration tests for page with valid and invalid order IDs
- [ ] Test authentication protection

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

### Unit Tests:

- Test OrderConfirmationSummary component renders order details correctly
- Test PaymentInformation component renders payment instructions
- Test NextSteps component renders expected content
- Test protection mechanism for unauthorized access

### Integration Tests:

- Test complete flow from order placement to confirmation page
- Test order details are correctly fetched and displayed
- Test route protection for authenticated vs unauthenticated users
- Test protection for users attempting to view orders they didn't place

### Manual/CLI Verification:

- Place a test order and verify redirection to the confirmation page
- Verify all order details are displayed correctly on the confirmation page
- Test accessing the confirmation page directly with a valid order ID (should work for the order owner)
- Test accessing the confirmation page directly with an invalid order ID (should show error)
- Test accessing the confirmation page for an order placed by another user (should be denied)
- Verify "View Order History" and "Continue Shopping" buttons work correctly
- Test responsive design by viewing the page on different device sizes
- Test localization by switching between languages
- Verify accessibility using keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
