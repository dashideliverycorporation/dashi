# Story 0.1: Project Initialization

Status: Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize the Next.js project with the appropriate configuration so that we have a solid foundation for development.

**Context:** This is the first story in Epic 0 (Initial Project & Core Infrastructure Setup). It establishes the foundational project structure and configuration that all subsequent stories will build upon. This story covers the initial setup of the project repository and core framework as outlined in the Architecture Document.

## Detailed Requirements

- Install Node.js, pnpm, and other required development tools
- Create a new Next.js project with App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and `/` directory structure
- Set up the basic project structure following Next.js App Router conventions
- Initialize Git repository with appropriate `.gitignore`
- Configure basic ESLint rules
- Set up initial README.md with project overview and setup instructions

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Next.js boilerplate application runs successfully with `pnpm dev`
- AC2: TypeScript is properly configured with strict type checking
- AC3: ESLint is properly configured and runs without errors
- AC4: Project is under Git version control with appropriate `.gitignore`
- AC5: Project structure follows Next.js App Router conventions with `/` directory

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

### Relevant Files:

- **Files to Create:** Initial Next.js project structure (created via CLI)
- **Files to Modify:** N/A (initial setup)

### Key Technologies:

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Tailwind CSS
- pnpm (package manager)
- Git (version control)

### API Interactions / SDK Usage:

- N/A for this story

### UI/UX Notes:

- N/A for this story (infrastructure focused)

### Data Structures:

- N/A for this story

### Environment Variables:

- N/A for initial setup (will be added in subsequent stories)

### Coding Standards Notes:

- Follow TypeScript strict mode configuration
- Use underscore prefix for private field names
- Add "Generated by Copilot" comment to all generated code
- Follow ESLint configuration generated by Next.js
- Project should follow the Next.js App Router structure as outlined in the architecture document

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] MANUAL STEP: Ensure Node.js (LTS recommended) and pnpm are installed
- [ ] Run `pnpm create next-app@latest` in the desired project directory
- [ ] Follow the prompts: choose "App Router", "TypeScript", "ESLint", "Tailwind CSS", "/ directory", and confirm
- [ ] Verify the default app starts by running `pnpm dev` and accessing the specified local URL
- [ ] Initialize a Git repository: `git init`
- [ ] Add all initial project files: `git add .`
- [ ] Create the initial commit: `git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, and App Router"`
- [ ] MANUAL STEP: Create a remote repository on a Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and link the local repository
- [ ] MANUAL STEP: Push the initial commit to the remote repository
- [ ] Update README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and basic documentation

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

### Unit Tests:

- N/A for this infrastructure setup story

### Integration Tests:

- N/A for this infrastructure setup story

### Manual/CLI Verification:

- Run `pnpm dev` to verify the Next.js development server starts without errors
- Verify the application loads correctly in the browser at the specified URL
- Run `pnpm lint` to verify ESLint is properly configured and no errors are reported
- Check that TypeScript configuration is set to strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Verify the project structure follows Next.js App Router conventions with a `/` directory
