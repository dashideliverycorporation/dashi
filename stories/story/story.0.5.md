# Story 0.5: Testing Framework Setup

Status: Completed

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Vitest and React Testing Library into the project to enable unit and component testing.

**Context:** This is the fifth story in Epic 0 (Initial Project & Core Infrastructure Setup). It focuses on setting up the testing environment using Vitest and React Testing Library. This testing infrastructure will enable TDD practices and ensure code quality across the project.

## Detailed Requirements

- Install and configure Vitest and React Testing Library in the Next.js project
- Set up appropriate test configurations for the Next.js application
- Create test scripts in package.json
- Implement a basic test to verify the testing environment works correctly

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Vitest, React Testing Library, and necessary dependencies are properly installed
- AC2: A vitest.config.ts file is created with appropriate configuration for the Next.js project
- AC3: Test scripts are added to package.json for running tests
- AC4: A basic test confirms the setup is functional
- AC5: Tests can be run using the defined scripts

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Developer agent is expected to follow project standards and understand the project structure. Only story-specific details are included below.

### Relevant Files:

- **Files to Create:**

  - `vitest.config.ts` - Configuration for Vitest
  - `app/tests/setup.ts` - Test setup file for including testing-library extensions
  - `app/utils/test-utils.tsx` - Utility functions for testing components

- **Files to Modify:**
  - `package.json` - Add test scripts and dependencies
  - Create a simple component test file to verify the setup

### Key Technologies:

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- Shadcn UI (for testing components with this library)

### API Interactions / SDK Usage:

- N/A for this testing setup story

### UI/UX Notes:

- N/A for this testing setup story

### Data Structures:

- N/A for this testing setup story

### Environment Variables:

- N/A for this testing setup story

### Coding Standards Notes:

- Follow Vitest and React Testing Library best practices
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing for test utilities
- Create helper functions for common testing patterns
- Document testing approaches with appropriate comments

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Install Vitest and related dependencies: `pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/ui happy-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event`
- [x] Create a `vitest.config.ts` file at the project root with appropriate configuration
- [x] Create a test setup file (e.g., `app/tests/setup.ts`) to import `@testing-library/jest-dom` extensions
- [x] Create testing utilities in `app/utils/test-utils.tsx` to simplify component testing
- [x] Add test scripts to `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "vitest", "test:ui": "vitest --ui", "test:run": "vitest run"`)
- [x] Create a simple test to verify the Vitest setup
- [x] Run the test script (`pnpm test:run`) and verify that the test passes
- [x] Document the testing approach in code comments

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

### Unit Tests:

- Create a basic unit test to verify Vitest works correctly
- Test should pass successfully when run with the defined test script

### Integration Tests:

- Create a simple component test to verify React Testing Library integration

### Manual Verification:

- Run the test scripts to ensure they execute correctly
- Verify that test results are properly displayed
- Check that the Vitest UI works if implemented

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

**Agent Model Used:** GitHub Copilot
**Completion Notes:** Successfully set up the testing framework using Vitest and React Testing Library. Created configuration files, test setup, and utility functions for testing. Added test scripts to package.json and created sample tests to verify the setup. All tasks completed and documented with comprehensive comments.
**Change Log:**

- Initial Draft
- May 7, 2025: Completed Testing Framework Setup using Vitest instead of Jest
